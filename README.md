# My portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, showcasing my web development projects and skills. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and the development environment is set up using Webpack.
> This portfolio was already created in vanilla JavaScript here https://github.com/valentave/Portfolio but for convenience I have decided to migrate it to React and correct some details.

## Sections

The portfolio website consists of the following sections:

### 1. Home
Welcome to my portfolio! This section provides a brief introduction to who I am and what I do as a frontend developer.

### 2. About
In the About section, I share more details about myself and my journey as a programmer. I talk about my passion for web development.

### 3. Skills
Here, I showcase the various languages/frameworks, and tools that I am proficient in.

### 4. Projects
The Projects section displays some of the web projects I've worked on. You'll find images, links, technologies and descriptions of each project, providing an overview of my work.

### 5. Contact
If you'd like to get in touch with me, this section contains links to my social media profiles and other contact information.
